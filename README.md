### The Game
	Project Fenrir is a traditional JRPG with combat mechanics akin to those of Fire Emblem
	and Final Fantasy Tactics. In the overworld, the player will explore areas to progress
	through the game, find objects and characters to interact with and initiate combat.
	Meanwhile, the combat will be composed of the player's party against an enemy party
	using a chess-like grid to move their units and try to defeat all enemy units on the
	grid. The game uses 2D sprites and animations to display the characters, environment,
	and information to the player.
