So far I am unable to get the window to be populated in windows. As of now Troubleshooting to get this to work.

The process I got this to work on my mac is as follows:
- pip3 install arcade
- python3 game_window_demo.py

I can confirm from running on my Mac and the screenshot sent to the group chat that this code is atleast valid. Another area worth testing is to get this configured in a virtual environment.
